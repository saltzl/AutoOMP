USERS GUIDE:

AutoOMP depends on an LLVM version >3.8

To compile this pass, the full source of LLVM must be available on the target machine. 

Steps:

After unzipping the package, create a "build" directory

In the build directory, run "cmake ../path/to/source"

After CMake completes, run "make"

This will build the pass


To run the pass, first compile a program to the llvm bitcode.
Then, run "opt -load ../path/to/pass.so -autoOMP ../path/to/bitcode -S output.ll"

This will create the llvm bitcode file converted to use open mp parallelism.



NOTE: 
	AutoOMP currently does not produce useable code. The calls to kpmc_fork_call, and kpmc_for_static_init are not being correctly formed. Once this is solved, autoOMP will be able to produce runnable openmp code
